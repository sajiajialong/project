<h1>I. Introduction</h1>

<div id="ii.-description-of-the-data-source" class="section level1">
<h1>II. Description of the data source</h1>
<p>We mainly collect row data from <code>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</code> and the link is: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/nyts/data/index.html" class="uri">https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/nyts/data/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>Data are available in SAS, Microsoft Access, and Microsoft Excel formats, as well as PDFs of the questionnaire, codebook, and methodology report.</p>
<p>The data reveals the smoking and tobacco usage among youth and collected by doing survey called <code>National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS)</code>. Data from 1999 and 2018 are available but we only choose those from 2011 to 2018 as the topics releated to electronic cigarette appear in these surveys as early as 2011. The data for a particular year, say 2018 looks like following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>DT::datatable(NYTS_2018_Full[1:20,15:20])</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"filter":"none","data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20"],["4","4","4","2","1","4","3","4","4","2","4","4","4","3","4","4","2","1","2","4"],["2","2","2","2","2","1","2","1","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","1","2","2"],["01","01","01","01","01","06","01","02","01","01","01","01","01","01","01","01","01","07","01","01"],["1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1"],[1,1,1,1,1,7,1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1],["1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Q6<\/th>\n      <th>Q7<\/th>\n      <th>Q8<\/th>\n      <th>Q9<\/th>\n      <th>Q10<\/th>\n      <th>Q11<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":5},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Of course this is just a small part of the whole data. The 2019 NYTS data has 20189 observations and 373 variables. But actually the survey has only 88 questions and the reason for 373 rather than variables is that some questions contains several response and thus needing more columns to store and there are also many columns contains some statistical index calculated by <code>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</code>. But all of those statistics are related to normal cigarettes and thus worth little to us.</p>
<p>The biggest problem for us is that the questions is different from year to year and we need to go through every questions in each year and select the questions that: 1. related to electronic cigarettes 2. appear at least four years 3. high quality and can reveal some “truth”</p>
